          <p>At its discretion, Cordial Bats reserves the right to change, modify, add or remove portions of these Terms of Service, its <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>, and other relevant policies by posting the amended terms on the Services.

It includes any games, titles, computer code, themes, objects, characters, character names, stories, dialogue, catchphrases, concepts, artwork, animations, sounds, musical compositions, audio-visual effects, methods of operation, moral rights, documentation, recordings of games played using a Cordial Bats game client.</p>

            <li>The Services are free of viruses or other harmful components.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties. Accordingly, some of the above disclaimers may not apply to you.</p>

          <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
          <p><b>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Cordial Bats shall not be liable to you for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive or other similar damages. Those damages include, but are not limited to, loss of revenues, lost profits, lost data or business interruption or other intangible losses arising out of or relating to these Terms of Service or the Services themselves. In addition, to the extent not prohibited by law, Cordial Bats shall not be liable to you for more than the amount you have paid to Cordial Bats per these Terms of Service in the six months immediately preceding the date you first assert a claim. You acknowledge and agree that if you have not paid anything to Cordial Bats during such period, your sole remedy (and our exclusive liability) for any dispute with Cordial Bats is to stop using the Services.</b></p>
          <p>Nothing in these Terms of Service shall affect the statutory rights of any consumer or exclude or restrict any liability resulting from gross negligence or willful misconduct of Cordial Bats or for death or personal injury arising from any negligence or fraud of Cordial Bats.</p>
          <p>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Cordial Bats (and our officers, directors, agents and employees) harmless from any claim, damages or other losses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) asserted by any third party resulting from your use of the Services, or any breach by you of these Terms of Service. However, the previous does not apply if the infringement of the rights is not attributable to your intentional or negligent behaviour.</p>

          <h2>6. Dispute Resolution</h2>
          <p>You and Cordial Bats agree that the processes for dispute resolution described in this agreement will apply to any dispute or claims related to these Terms of Service, the <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>, or the Services. Disputes include any claims of any kind, including but not limited to legal, equitable, or statutory claims.</p>
          <p>If a dispute arises between you and Cordial Bats, we strongly encourage you to contact us directly to seek a resolution by contacting <a href="mailto:support@cordialbats.com">support@cordialbats.com</a>.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If you are a resident of France, these Terms of Service and any dispute arising out of or related to it or the <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> or the Services shall be governed in all respects by French law, without regard to conflict of law provisions. You agree that any claim or dispute against Cordial Bats must be resolved exclusively by a court located in France.</li>
            <li>If you are a resident outside of France, you agree that all disputes between you and Cordial Bats shall be governed by the laws of France, without regard to conflict of law provisions. Furthermore, you agree that any claim or dispute against Cordial Bats must be resolved exclusively by a court located in France.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>7. Severability</h2>
          <p>You and Cordial Bats agree that if any portion of these Terms of Service or the <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> is found illegal or unenforceable, in whole or in part by any court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective. Such provision shall be ineffective solely to the extent of such determination of invalidity. It does not affect the validity or enforceability in any other jurisdiction and does not affect the remaining provisions of the terms.</p>

          <h2>8. General Provisions</h2>

          <h3>8.1. Assignment</h3>
          <p>Cordial Bats may assign or delegate these Terms of Service or the <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>, in whole or in part, to any person or entity, at any time, with or without your consent. However, you may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under the Terms of Service or <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> without our prior written consent. Any unauthorised assignment and delegation by you are ineffective.</p>

          <h3>8.2. Supplemental Policies</h3>
          <p>Cordial Bats may publish additional policies related to specific services such as forums, contests or loyalty programs. Your right to use such services is subject to those specific policies and these Terms of Service.</p>

          <h3>8.3. Entire Agreement</h3>
          <p>These Terms of Service, any supplemental policies and any documents expressly incorporated by reference herein (including the <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>) contain the entire understanding of you and Cordial Bats. In addition, they supersede all prior understandings of the parties hereto relating to the subject matter hereof, whether electronic, oral or written, or whether established by custom, practice, policy or precedent, between you and us concerning the Services.</p>

          <h3>8.4. No Waiver</h3>
          <p>The failure of Cordial Bats to require or enforce strict performance by you of any provision of these Terms of Service or the <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> or failure to exercise any right under them shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of Cordial Bats‚Äô right to assert or rely upon any such provision or right in that or any other instance.</p>
          <p>The express waiver by Cordial Bats of any provision, condition, or requirement of these Terms of Service or the <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> shall not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement.</p>
          <p>Except as expressly and specifically outlined in this these Terms of Service, no representations, statements, consents, waivers, or other acts or omissions by Cordial Bats shall be deemed a modification of these Terms of Service nor legally binding unless documented in physical writing, hand signed by you and a duly appointed officer of Cordial Bats.</p>

          <h3>8.5. Notices</h3>
          <p>We may notify you via postings in our games or any other communication means to contact you provide to us. All notices given by you or required from you under these Terms of Service or the <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> shall be in writing and addressed to <a href="mailto:support@cordialbats.com">support@cordialbats.com</a>.</p>

          <h3>8.6. Equitable Remedies</h3>
          <p>You acknowledge that the rights granted and obligations made under these Terms of Service to Cordial Bats are of a unique and irreplaceable nature. The loss of those rights and obligations irreparably harms Cordial Bats. It cannot be replaced by monetary damages alone. Cordial Bats shall be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief (without the obligations of posting any bond or surety or proof of damages) in the event of a breach or anticipatory breach by you.</p>
          <p>You irrevocably waive all rights to seek injunctive or other equitable relief or to enjoin or restrain the operation of the Services, or exploitation of the Services or any content or other material used or displayed through the Services and agree to limit your claims to claims for monetary damages, limited by Section 5 (if any).</p>

          <h3>8.7. Force Majeure</h3>
          <p>Cordial Bats shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside the reasonable control of Cordial Bats, including without limitation any failure to perform hereunder due to unforeseen circumstances or cause beyond Cordial Bats‚Äô control such as war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes, or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labour or materials.</p>
